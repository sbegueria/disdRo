# disdRo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/97455750.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/97455750)

An R package for reading and handling meteorological particle size and
velocity distribution (PSVD), or disdrometric matrix data, from raw data
files generated by **Thies LPM** or **Ott Parsivel** optical disdrometers.

You can cite this package on your work as:

## Details

Disdrometers are devices used to measure the particle size distribution and
velocity of falling hydrometeors.
They have multiple uses in automatic meterological networks and in climatology.
The Thies LPM and the Ott Parsivel are among the most common commercial
disdrometers.
This package allows reading and working with raw data files generated by
these two disdrometers, within R.

It currently conatains the workhorse functions `dsd_read()`, `dsd_integrate()`
and `dsd_plot()`, but other functionalities may be added in the future.
Support for other disdrometer types may be also be incorporated, althought
there are no fixed plans for that.


## Installation

Install the latest stable development version from GitHub:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github('sbegueria/disdRo', build_vignettes=TRUE)
```
You can of course skip the vignettes to save compilation time.


## Using the package

Once installed, you should load the package:

```r
library(disdRo)
```

Consult the help page of the package:

```r
help(package='disdRo')
```
You can check the help pages for the individual functions, or the more more
comprehensive user guide (vignette).
The vignettes can also be accessed directly in your browser via:

```r
browseVignettes('disdRo')
```

Finally, you can also find the html vignettes on github, on the
'disdRo/vignettes' directory.
